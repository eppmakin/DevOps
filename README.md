# DevOps assignment

## Description

This project is a web application developed as part of a group assignment for a studying project of JYU course TJTS5901 - Continuous Software Engineering.

The application allows users to perform off-market trades for a single stock, specifically focused on APPLE (AAPL). Orders are matched outside of a stock exchange, and the web application interacts with end users through a REST API. It fetches the latest market data of the stock from a feed to validate the price of input orders.

More info about the data used: https://docs.marketdata.app/docs/api.
